# Cross-version benchmark sweep launcher (--quick by default).
#
# Activates the configured venv, pins declearn to each requested
# released version in turn, and runs the ASV suite with `--quick`
# (one sample per cell). This matches our usage model: declearn FL
# benchmarks are network/Python-bound, not GPU-bound, and we care
# about ~2× regressions, not 5% noise. Set FULL=1 to run the multi-
# sample noise-aware mode instead.
#
# Each version's results are tagged with the matching declearn git
# commit so ASV plots them on a version timeline.
#
# Usage:
#   ./run_benchmarks.sh                              # --quick, default versions
#   ./run_benchmarks.sh 2.7.0 2.8.0                  # explicit released versions
#   ./run_benchmarks.sh path:/abs/path/to/declearn   # local checkout (e.g. a fork)
#   FULL=1 ./run_benchmarks.sh                       # multi-sample, slow but tighter
#
# `path:` mode installs declearn from a local directory (via
# `pip install <path> --no-deps`) and tags the asv result with the
# checkout's `git rev-parse HEAD`. Use this to benchmark a fork or
# in-progress branch alongside released versions; results land in
# .asv/results/<machine>/<sha>-<env>.json same as for released versions.
